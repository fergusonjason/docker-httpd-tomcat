# docker-httpd-tomcat-rabbitmq

This is my Docker project to create a Tomcat Cluster with an Apache httpd frontend to load-balance it. It is based on the work of Paritosh Anand and his project located at https://github.com/Paritosh-Anand/Docker-Httpd-Tomcat.

TODO List:
- One tomcat configuration to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
- Activate Manager on tomcat nodes so I can deploy app via Maven Cargo
- Get a cert from Let's Encrypt so I can use https
